# Web Scraping and Analyzing Performance of Your Content (Posts) on LinkedIn

*"Has the number of likes I get on LinkedIn went up or down over the past year?"*

**Here is what the program does:**

1. Automatically logs in to your LinkedIn & opens the recent activity page;
2. Scrapes the number of likes, comments, and views your posts received (number of posts specified by the user);
3. Outputs 3 graphs with trend lines and 3 .csv files.

**THIS REPOSITORY INCLUDES**
1. Full Python script;
2. Examples of produced graphs.


See the Python script in this repository for detailed comments and explanations.

Note: initial version only works through an IDEA.
